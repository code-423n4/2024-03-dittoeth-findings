In LibOracle.sol, there are calls to IDiamond(...).estimateWETHInUSDC(...), but I was wondering if the input and output are as expected, which is not possible if IDiamond.sol is missing in the repo. Moreover, there are some test implementations of estimateWETHInUSDC, but for the 2nd variable with the LibOracle.sol the input is "30 minutes", but in the test versions of the function, with the very same name, the expected type of "secondsAgo" is uint32, so either there is missing converting from the string to integer or somewhere unknown is the converting.
