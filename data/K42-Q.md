#### Quality Assurance Report for [DittoEth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth) by K42

## Introduction

Focusing on the six smart contracts and six supporting libraries. This review aims to identify potential issues related to security, code quality, and adherence to best practices.

## My Findings and Recommended Mitigations

### Low Severity

1. Inconsistent use of named return variables in functions like `createBid`, `createForcedBid`, and `exitShortWallet`.
   - Mitigation: Use named return variables consistently throughout the codebase or stick to explicit return statements for clarity and readability.

2. Missing events for state changes in functions such as `disputeRedemption`, `claimRedemption`, and `cancelOrder`.
   - Mitigation: Emit events for all significant state changes to improve transparency and facilitate off-chain monitoring of contract activity.

3. Usage of hardcoded numeric constants like `0.75 ether`, `1.7 ether`, and `30 minutes` instead of named constants.
   - Mitigation: Define named constants for frequently used values to enhance readability and maintainability of the codebase.

4. Inconsistent explicitness of function visibility specifiers.
   - Mitigation: Explicitly declare visibility for all functions to avoid ambiguity and improve code clarity.

### Non-Critical

1. Code duplication in `transferBridgeCredit` and `assessDeth` functions.
   - Mitigation: Refactor common logic into internal helper functions to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

2. Long and complex functions like `bidMatchAlgo`, `proposeRedemption`, and `liquidate`.
   - Mitigation: Break down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions to enhance readability and modularity.

3. Inconsistent naming conventions for constants (e.g., `C.ONE_THIRD` vs `C.HEAD`).
   - Mitigation: Adopt and adhere to a consistent naming convention for constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.

4. Unused `console.sol` library in `RedemptionFacet.sol`.
   - Mitigation: Remove unused imports to keep the codebase clean and minimize contract size.

5. Unnecessary type casting of `incomingBid.ercAmount` in `exitShort`.
   - Mitigation: Remove unnecessary type casting to improve code readability and reduce potential confusion.

### [BidOrdersFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/BidOrdersFacet.sol)

- `createForcedBid` assumes strict access control in the Diamond contract.
  - Mitigation: Implement a multi-sig mechanism or a timelock contract to manage access to critical functions like `createForcedBid`.

- `_shortDirectionHandler` modifies `MTypes.BidMatchAlgo` despite being marked as `view`.
  - Mitigation: Remove the `view` modifier from the `_shortDirectionHandler` function signature to accurately reflect its behavior.

- Complex `bidMatchAlgo` function with nested loops.
  - Mitigation: Refactor the `bidMatchAlgo` function into smaller, more focused functions to improve readability, maintainability, and gas efficiency.

### [ShortOrdersFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/ShortOrdersFacet.sol)

- `createLimitShort` performs various checks and calculations, making it difficult to follow.
  - Mitigation: Refactor the `createLimitShort` function by extracting validation and state update logic into separate functions to improve readability and modularity.

- No explicit access control for `createLimitShort`.
  - Mitigation: Implement a role-based access control system to restrict access to the `createLimitShort` function based on predefined roles.

### [PrimaryLiquidationFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol)

- `liquidate` is susceptible to front-running attacks.
  - Mitigation: Implement a commit-reveal scheme or a time-based mechanism for submitting liquidation requests to mitigate front-running risks.

- Low-level `call` and `staticcall` operations without proper validation and error handling.
  - Mitigation: Ensure all external calls are properly validated and implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### [ExitShortFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/ExitShortFacet.sol)

- Complex `exitShort` function with multiple external calls and state updates.
  - Mitigation: Refactor the `exitShort` function into smaller, focused functions that handle specific tasks to improve readability and maintainability.

- Lack of price validation mechanisms to prevent price manipulation.
  - Mitigation: Incorporate price validation techniques, such as time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or multi-source price oracles, to mitigate price manipulation risks.

### [RedemptionFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/RedemptionFacet.sol)

- Risk of malicious redemption proposals with manipulated data.
  - Mitigation: Implement strict input validation and consistency checks to verify the integrity of redemption proposals and reject invalid or inconsistent data.

- Reliance on external data sources for redemption calculations.
  - Mitigation: Utilize multiple independent data sources or a decentralized oracle network to cross-verify the integrity of the data used in the redemption process.

### [BridgeRouterFacet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/facets/BridgeRouterFacet.sol)

- Dependence on the security of external bridge contracts.
  - Mitigation: Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of the bridge contracts and implement additional safety checks and error handling mechanisms.

- No proper access control for sensitive data updates.
  - Mitigation: Implement a granular role-based access control system to restrict access to critical state-modifying functions and consider using a multi-sig mechanism for sensitive operations.

### [LibBridgeRouter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibBridgeRouter.sol)

- Lack of comprehensive input validation and error handling.
  - Mitigation: Implement thorough input validation checks and include meaningful error messages and revert statements to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

- No explicit access control for `AppStorage` modifications.
  - Mitigation: Ensure only authorized contracts and functions can modify relevant data in `AppStorage` by implementing a whitelist or role-based access control system.

### [LibBytes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibBytes.sol)

- Usage of inline assembly in `readProposalData`, which can be error-prone.
  - Mitigation: Thoroughly test and validate the inline assembly code to ensure its correctness and safety. Consider using Solidity's built-in `abi.decode` function or a well-tested library for parsing complex data structures.

### [LibOracle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibOracle.sol)

- Circuit breaker mechanisms relying on a single oracle source.
  - Mitigation: Integrate multiple independent oracle sources or a decentralized oracle network to enhance resilience against price manipulation attacks.

  - Mitigation: Regularly review and update external libraries to the latest stable versions and conduct thorough integration testing to verify compatibility and correct behavior.

### [LibSRUtil](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/libraries/LibSRUtil.sol)

- No checks to prevent unauthorized transfers or ensure data integrity in `transferShortRecord`.
  - Mitigation: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict the ability to transfer short records to authorized contracts or users. Validate transferred data to ensure it matches the expected format and values.

- Direct modification of sensitive storage variables without validation or consistency checks.
  - Mitigation: Implement input validation and consistency checks for all storage-modifying operations. Use Solidity's `require` statements to enforce preconditions and postconditions.

### [UniswapOracleLibrary](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth//blob/main/contracts/libraries/UniswapOracleLibrary.sol)

- Assumption of sufficient pool liquidity and valid price observations in `estimateTWAP`.
  - Mitigation: Include sanity checks for pool liquidity and the validity of observed prices. Implement fallback mechanisms to handle cases where pool liquidity is low or price data is unreliable.

- No explicit checks for compatibility and correct behavior of Uniswap V3 pool contracts and `TickMath` library.
  - Mitigation: Regularly monitor the Uniswap V3 protocol for updates or changes that may affect compatibility or functionality. Conduct thorough integration testing with various pool configurations and tick ranges.

## Conclusion
Addressing these issues will improve the overall maintainability, readability, and longevity of [DittoEth](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth). The project would benefit from refactoring complex functions, implementing stricter access controls, and conducting further thorough testing to ensure the correct behaviour of the contracts and libraries.
