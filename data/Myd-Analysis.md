## 4. Codebase Quality Analysis

### 4.1. Code Structure and Readability

The DittoETH codebase follows a modular structure, separating concerns into different contracts and libraries. The code is well-organized and uses descriptive naming conventions, enhancing readability and maintainability. However, **there are instances where function and variable names could be more intuitive, and additional comments would improve code comprehension.**

### 4.2. Use of Libraries and Standards

The codebase makes use of libraries and standards such as SafeMath, IERC20, and Ownable, which is a good practice. These libraries help prevent common vulnerabilities and provide standard interfaces for token interactions. **However, there are instances where custom implementations are used instead of well-tested and audited libraries, which may introduce potential risks.**

### 4.3. Error Handling and Validation

The codebase includes error handling and validation mechanisms to prevent invalid or malicious interactions. The use of require statements and custom error messages helps in validating input parameters and contract state. H**owever, there are cases where more comprehensive error handling and informative error messages could be implemented to provide better feedback to users and facilitate** debugging.

### 4.4. Code Duplication and Reusability

The codebase demonstrates efforts to minimize code duplication by using modifiers and internal functions. This promotes code reusability and maintainability. **However, there are instances where similar functionality is implemented in multiple places, leading to potential inconsistencies and increased maintenance overhead.**

1. Centralization Risks:
   - Admin control over critical protocol parameters and functions
   - Lack of sufficient checks and balances on admin actions
   - Potential for admin abuse or single point of failure

2. Order Book Vulnerabilities:
   - Possibility of front-running and manipulation in the order matching process
   - Incomplete handling of edge cases and market volatility scenarios
   - Potential for inconsistencies and inaccuracies in order execution

3. Stablecoin Minting and Redemption:
   - Insufficient validation and checks on collateral requirements and stablecoin supply
   - Potential for unauthorized minting or redemption due to improper access control
   - Risks associated with managing collateral and ensuring accurate accounting

4. Liquidation Mechanism:
   - Potential for manipulation or gaming of the liquidation process
   - Insufficient incentives for timely and fair liquidations
   - Risks related to pricing and distribution of liquidation rewards

5. Oracle Dependence:
   - Reliance on external price oracles for asset valuation and liquidation calculations
   - Vulnerability to oracle failures, delays, or manipulation
   - Lack of robust fallback mechanisms and price sanity checks

6. Governance and Upgrade Risks:
   - Potential for malicious or careless governance decisions
   - Insufficient safeguards and checks on the upgrade process
   - Risks associated with implementing and deploying protocol upgrades

7. Code Quality and Security:
   - Instances of code duplication and inconsistencies
   - Insufficient error handling and informative error messages
   - Potential for vulnerabilities due to custom implementations instead of well-tested libraries

These weaknesses represent potential entry points for attackers or sources of instability within the DittoETH protocol. It is crucial to address these weaknesses through a combination of robust design, thorough testing, and continuous monitoring and improvement.

The entry point diagram shows the main components of the DittoETH protocol and the associated potential weaknesses. Attackers may target these entry points to exploit vulnerabilities, manipulate the system, or cause instability. By focusing on securing these critical areas and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the DittoETH protocol can enhance its overall security posture and reduce the risk of successful attacks or failures.


## 5. Centralization Risks

### 5.1. Access Control Mechanisms

The DittoETH protocol utilizes access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to admin roles. While this is necessary for protocol management, it introduces centralization risks. The codebase should clearly define and document the admin roles, their permissions, and the scenarios in which they can be used.

For example: 
```solidity
contract DittoETH is Ownable {
    // ...

    function setCollateralRatio(uint256 newRatio) external onlyOwner {
        // Set new collateral ratio
        // ...
    }
}
```
**NOTE:** This is just a code example.
In the above example, the `setCollateralRatio` function is restricted to the contract owner, granting them the ability to modify the collateral ratio. This centralized control could potentially be abused if not properly governed.

### 5.2. Timelock and Governance Mechanisms

To mitigate centralization risks, the DittoETH protocol should implement timelock and governance mechanisms. Timelock ensures that admin actions are delayed, allowing users to review and potentially oppose them. Governance mechanisms enable community participation in decision-making processes.

**Recommendation:** Implement a timelock contract that delays the execution of admin actions and allows the community to review and vote on proposed changes. Integrate a governance framework, such as OpenZeppelin's Governor contract, to enable decentralized decision-making.

### 5.3. Emergency Stop Mechanism

The DittoETH protocol includes an emergency stop mechanism that allows the contract owner to pause contract functionalities in the event of a critical issue. However, this mechanism introduces centralization risk, as it grants significant power to the contract owner.

**Recommendation**: Implement a multisig mechanism for emergency actions, requiring multiple trusted parties to approve the action. Additionally, clearly define and document the circumstances under which the emergency stop mechanism can be triggered.

## 6. Mechanism Review

### 6.1. Order Book Matching

The DittoETH protocol utilizes an order book mechanism to match buy and sell orders for stablecoin minting and redemption. The order book matching algorithm should ensure fair and accurate order execution while preventing front-running and manipulation.

**Recommendation**: Implement a batch auction mechanism or a time-weighted average price (TWAP) algorithm to mitigate front-running risks. Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and market manipulation scenarios, to verify the robustness of the order book matching mechanism.

### 6.2. Stablecoin Minting and Redemption

The stablecoin minting and redemption processes in DittoETH involve user interactions with the order book and collateral management. These mechanisms should ensure the stability of the stablecoin, maintain adequate collateralization, and prevent unauthorized minting or redemption.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive validation checks for minting and redemption requests, including collateral balance, collateral ratio, and stablecoin supply limits. Regularly monitor and adjust the collateral ratio based on market conditions and protocol health.

### 6.3. Liquidation Mechanism

The DittoETH protocol includes a liquidation mechanism to ensure that undercollateralized positions are liquidated promptly to maintain the stability of the system. The liquidation process should be fair, efficient, and resistant to manipulation.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L47-L90

**Recommendation:** Implement a robust liquidation mechanism that incentivizes timely liquidations and prevents abuse. Consider using a Dutch auction or a fixed-price liquidation model to ensure fair pricing. Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and market volatility scenarios, to validate the liquidation mechanism's effectiveness.

## 7. Systemic Risks

### 7.1. Oracle Dependence and Manipulation

The DittoETH protocol relies on external price oracles to fetch asset prices for collateral valuation and liquidation calculations. The dependence on oracles introduces systemic risks, as oracle failures or manipulation can impact the protocol's stability.

Recommendation: Implement a robust Oracle system that combines multiple reliable price sources and includes price sanity checks and outlier detection. Consider using a time-weighted average price (TWAP) or a medianizer to mitigate the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Regularly monitor and assess the Oracle system's performance and reliability.

### 7.2. Liquidity and Market Risks

The DittoETH protocol's stability and user experience depend on the liquidity and market conditions of the underlying assets. Insufficient liquidity or extreme market volatility can lead to issues such as high slippage, difficulty in order execution, and potential liquidity crises.

**Recommendation:** Implement mechanisms to incentivize liquidity provision, such as liquidity mining or transaction fee sharing. Establish partnerships with market makers and liquidity providers to ensure sufficient liquidity across different market conditions. Regularly monitor and assess the protocol's liquidity metrics and market risks, and have contingency plans in place to handle liquidity crises.

### 7.3. Governance and Upgrade Risks

The DittoETH protocol's governance and upgrade mechanisms introduce systemic risks, as malicious or careless governance decisions can have severe consequences for the protocol and its users. Poorly designed or implemented upgrade processes can lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.

**Recommendation:** Implement a robust governance framework that includes checks and balances, such as multisig approvals and time-locks, to prevent hasty or malicious governance decisions. Conduct thorough testing and auditing of any proposed upgrades to ensure their correctness and security. Establish clear communication channels with the community to foster transparency and gather feedback on governance proposals.

## 8. Conclusion

My analysis of the DittoETH codebase reveals several potential risks and areas for improvement. While the protocol demonstrates a well-structured architecture and utilizes standard libraries and practices, there are instances of centralization risks, mechanism vulnerabilities, and systemic dependencies that require attention.

To enhance the security and reliability of the DittoETH protocol, it is recommended to address the identified issues, implement robust validation and error handling, and establish strong governance and risk management frameworks. Regular audits, thorough testing, and continuous monitoring are essential to ensure the protocol's long-term stability and success.

By addressing the highlighted concerns and incorporating the provided recommendations, the DittoETH protocol can strengthen its security posture, mitigate potential risks, and provide a trusted and reliable stablecoin solution for its users.


### For potential security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and improvement points.

I provided detailed insights and actionable recommendations that can be applied to enhance the security and robustness of the code.
----------------------
[`proposeRedemption`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/RedemptionFacet.sol#L56-L114), which allows users to submit a proposal for redeeming their dUSD for collateral from ShortRecords. The function takes the following key inputs:
- `asset`: The address of the asset being redeemed.
- `proposalInput`: An array of `MTypes.ProposalInput` structs, each containing a ShortRecord's `shorter` address, `shortId`, and `shortOrderId`.
- `redemptionAmount`: The total amount of dUSD the user wants to redeem.
- `maxRedemptionFee`: The maximum fee the user is willing to pay for the redemption.

```solidity
function proposeRedemption(
    address asset,
    MTypes.ProposalInput[] calldata proposalInput,
    uint88 redemptionAmount,
    uint88 maxRedemptionFee
) external isNotFrozen(asset) nonReentrant {
    // Function body
}
```

**The function performs the following steps:**
1. Validates the input parameters and checks the user's dUSD balance.
2. Iterates through the `proposalInput` array and validates each ShortRecord.
3. Calculates the CR of each ShortRecord and checks if it's below the maximum redemption CR.
4. Updates the state variables to reflect the proposed redemption.
5. Calculates the redemption fee and the dispute period based on the highest CR in the proposal.
6. Emits a `ProposeRedemption` event.

The specific issues are:
- The function does not check if the `proposalInput` array contains duplicate ShortRecord entries.
- The function does not verify if the ShortRecords in the `proposalInput` array are valid and eligible for redemption.
- The function does not limit the number of proposals a user can submit within a certain time frame.

**Recommendation:**

a. Duplicate Proposal Check:
- Add a check to prevent duplicate ShortRecord entries in the `proposalInput` array.
- Use a mapping or a set data structure to keep track of the ShortRecords included in the proposal.
- Reject the proposal if any duplicate entries are detected.

b. Proposal Validation:
- Implement thorough validation checks for each ShortRecord in the `proposalInput` array.
- Verify that the ShortRecords meet the eligibility criteria for redemption (e.g., valid shorter address, shortId, CR below the maximum).
- Reject the proposal if any invalid or ineligible ShortRecords are found.

c. Rate Limiting:
- Implement rate limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of proposals a user can submit within a certain time frame.
- Use a mapping to keep track of the user's proposal count and last proposal timestamp.
- Reject the proposal if the user exceeds the rate limit.

d. Proposal Fee:
- Introduce a proposal fee that users must pay when submitting a redemption proposal.
- The fee should be high enough to discourage spam but not too high to deter legitimate users.
- The fee can be adjusted dynamically based on the network congestion and proposal volume.

1. Potential Weakness: Lack of Input Validation

Several functions in the code lack proper input validation. For example, the [`liquidate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L47-L90) function does not validate the length of the `shortHintArray` array, which could potentially lead to excessive gas consumption or denial-of-service attacks if a large array is passed.

**Recommendation:**
Implement input validation checks for all external functions. Validate the length and contents of input arrays, such as `shortHintArray`, to ensure they are within acceptable bounds. Revert the transaction if the input is invalid or exceeds the defined limits. This helps prevent abuse and ensures the stability of the contract.

2. Potential Weakness: Unchecked Return Values

The code uses low-level calls to interact with external contracts, such as [`IDiamond(payable(address(this))).createForcedBid(...)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L188). **However, the return values of these calls are not checked for success or failure.**

**Recommendation:**
Always check the return values of external contract calls to handle potential failures gracefully. Use the `require` statement or appropriate error handling mechanisms to ensure that the calls are successful before proceeding with further execution. This helps maintain the integrity of the contract and prevents unexpected behavior.

3. Potential Vulnerability: Integer Overflow/Underflow

The code performs arithmetic operations on `uint88` and `uint256` variables, such as [`m.ethFilled.mulU88(m.tappFeePct)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L213) and [`m.totalFee += tappFee + callerFee`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L216). **However, there are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow.**

**Recommendation:**
Use the SafeMath library or built-in Solidity features (if using Solidity 0.8.0 or higher) to perform arithmetic operations safely. These libraries and features automatically check for overflow and underflow conditions and revert the transaction if an error occurs. This prevents unintended behavior and ensures the correctness of mathematical calculations.

5. Potential Weakness: Missing Access Control

The [`_fullorPartialLiquidation`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L240-L278) function allows anyone to call it and perform liquidations. There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can initiate liquidations.

**Recommendation:**
Implement appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or contracts can call critical functions like `_fullorPartialLiquidation`. Use modifiers or role-based access control to restrict access to specific functions based on the caller's permissions. This helps prevent unauthorized actions and maintains the integrity of the liquidation process.

6. Potential Improvement: Gas Optimization

The code iterates over arrays and performs multiple storage reads and writes, which can be gas-intensive. For example, the `_fullorPartialLiquidation` function iterates over the `shortHintArray` array and performs storage operations within the loop.

**Recommendation:**
Optimize gas usage by minimizing storage reads and writes within loops. Consider using memory variables to store intermediate results and update storage only when necessary. Additionally, explore alternative data structures or algorithms that can reduce the number of iterations and improve gas efficiency.

7. Potential Weakness: Lack of Event Logging

The code does not emit events for important actions, such as liquidations, partial liquidations, and fee distributions. Event logging is crucial for transparency, auditing, and monitoring purposes.

**Recommendation:**
Implement event logging for significant actions and state changes in the contract. Emit events for liquidations, partial liquidations, fee distributions, and other relevant operations. This allows external entities to track and monitor the contract's behavior and facilitates debugging and auditing.

8. Potential Improvement: Code Documentation and Comments

The code lacks sufficient documentation and comments explaining the purpose, functionality, and assumptions of various functions and variables.

**Recommendation:**
Enhance the code's readability and maintainability by adding comprehensive documentation and comments. Provide clear explanations of the contract's purpose, the roles of different functions, and any assumptions or constraints. Use NatSpec comments to document function parameters, return values, and any special considerations. Well-documented code reduces the chances of misinterpretation and makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

9. Potential Vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation

The code relies on external price oracles, such as Chainlink, to determine asset prices. However, there is a risk of oracle manipulation if the oracle data is not properly validated or if there are vulnerabilities in the oracle system itself.

**Recommendation:**
Implement robust oracle price validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the price data. Use multiple oracle sources and compare the prices to detect and mitigate potential manipulation attempts. Additionally, consider implementing price deviation thresholds and circuit breakers to prevent the use of abnormal or unreliable price data.

10. Potential Improvement: Error Handling and Revert Reasons

The code uses generic revert statements, such as `revert Errors.TooManyHints()`, without providing detailed error messages or reasons.

Recommendation:
Enhance the error handling mechanism by including informative revert reasons along with the error codes. Provide clear and descriptive error messages that explain the specific reason for the revert. This helps developers and users understand the cause of the error and facilitates debugging and troubleshooting.

These are some of the key potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and improvement points I identified in the.

## My Analysis focusing on the newly introduced redemption mechanism and its potential vulnerabilities.

### Summary
The redemption mechanism in the DittoETH protocol allows users to redeem their dUSD for collateral from ShortRecords based on the collateral ratio (CR) of the positions. The mechanism involves a multi-step process where users propose redemptions, and other users can dispute the proposals within a specified timeframe. I focus on identifying any logic flaws, race conditions, or exploitable vulnerabilities in the redemption process and verifying that it strictly follows the defined rules.

**My Findings:**

1. Logic Flaw in Redemption Proposal Validation:

Description: The `proposeRedemption` function validates the proposed ShortRecords based on their CR and updates the state variables accordingly. However, there is a logic flaw in the validation process that allows users to propose redemptions for ShortRecords that do not meet the CR criteria.

The flaw lies in the fact that the loop continues to the next proposal if the CR is above the maximum redemption CR, without reverting the transaction or properly handling the invalid proposal.

**Recommendation:** Modify the logic to revert the transaction if any of the proposed ShortRecords do not meet the CR criteria, ensuring that only valid redemption proposals are processed.

2. Potential Race Condition in Redemption Dispute:

Description: [`disputeRedemption`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/RedemptionFacet.sol#L224-L301) function allows users to dispute redemption proposals by providing a ShortRecord with a lower CR. However, there is a potential race condition vulnerability if multiple users attempt to dispute the same proposal simultaneously.

[#L259](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/RedemptionFacet.sol#L259-L260)

```solidity
function disputeRedemption(address asset, address redeemer, uint8 incorrectIndex, address disputeShorter, uint8 disputeShortId)
external
    // ...

    // Check if the dispute is valid
    if (disputeCR < incorrectProposal.CR && disputeSR.updatedAt + C.DISPUTE_REDEMPTION_BUFFER <= redeemerAssetUser.timeProposed) {
        // Remove the incorrect proposals and update state variables
        // ...
    } else {
        revert Errors.InvalidRedemptionDispute();
    }
}
```

If multiple users submit dispute transactions with valid ShortRecords, the order in which the disputes are processed becomes critical. The current implementation does not handle concurrent disputes properly, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates or incorrect dispute resolutions.

**Recommendation:** Implement a locking mechanism or a queue system to handle concurrent disputes and ensure that disputes are processed in a deterministic and fair manner.

3. Incorrect Ordering of Redemption Proposals:

Description: The redemption mechanism requires that redemption proposals are fulfilled in the order of lowest CR to highest CR. **However, the current implementation does not enforce strict ordering of the proposals.**

The loop processes the proposals in the order they are provided, without explicitly sorting them based on CR. This can lead to redemptions being fulfilled out of order, violating the defined rules.

**Recommendation**: Implement a sorting mechanism to ensure that redemption proposals are processed in the correct order, from lowest CR to highest CR. This can be done by sorting the `proposalInput` array based on CR before processing the proposals.

4. Insufficient Dispute Period for High CR Proposals:

Description: The dispute period for redemption proposals is calculated based on the CR of the ShortRecords. **However, the current implementation may not provide sufficient time for users to dispute proposals with high CRs.**

If the dispute period is too short for high CR proposals, it may not allow enough time for users to identify and dispute incorrect proposals effectively.

**Recommendation:** Review and adjust the dispute period calculation to ensure that it provides sufficient time for users to dispute proposals across all CR ranges. Consider implementing a minimum dispute period or a logarithmic scale for the dispute period based on CR.

### My Conclusion:
My security analysis of the DittoETH redemption mechanism has identified several potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. The most critical issue is the logic flaw in the redemption proposal validation, which allows users to propose invalid redemptions. Additionally, there are concerns regarding race conditions in the dispute process, incorrect ordering of redemption proposals, and insufficient dispute periods for high CR proposals.

To ensure the security and integrity of the redemption mechanism, it is recommended to address these findings and implement the suggested mitigations. The code should be thoroughly reviewed and tested to identify any further vulnerabilities or edge cases.


> Now Focusing on the security aspects of the orderbook matching algorithm, with particular emphasis on the handling of Short Orders, the potential vulnerabilities in the oracle price caching and hint system, and the robustness of the 0.5% buffer and backwards matching approach for Short Orders. I aim to identify any potential manipulations, gaming opportunities, or vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity and fairness of the orderbook matching process.

1. Oracle Price Caching Manipulation:

Description: The DittoETH protocol uses a 15-minute cached oracle price to optimize gas costs and reduce the number of external calls to the oracle. However, this caching mechanism can be manipulated by an attacker to influence the orderbook matching process.

An attacker can exploit this caching mechanism by strategically placing orders just before the 15-minute cache expires, knowing that the cached price may not reflect the current market conditions. This can lead to unintended matching of orders at stale prices.

**Recommendation**: Implement a more robust oracle price caching system that takes into account the market volatility and the potential impact of stale prices. Consider reducing the caching window, introducing price deviation checks, or using a time-weighted average price (TWAP) to mitigate the risk of price manipulation.

3. Hint System Gaming:

Description: The hint system used for gas optimization in the orderbook matching algorithm can be gamed by malicious users to influence the matching process.

A malicious user can provide misleading or manipulative hints to the `placeOrder` function, potentially causing the order to be placed in an unintended position within the orderbook. This can disrupt the fair matching of orders and lead to undesirable outcomes.

**Recommendation:** Implement robust validation and sanity checks on the hints provided by users. Verify the integrity and correctness of the hints before using them for order placement. Consider alternative gas optimization techniques that are less susceptible to manipulation, such as maintaining a separate index or using a more secure data structure.

4. 0.5% Buffer and Backwards Matching Robustness:

Description: The DittoETH protocol implements a 0.5% buffer and a backwards matching approach for Short Orders when the oracle price changes. While this mechanism aims to provide flexibility and improve user experience, it may introduce potential vulnerabilities.

The 0.5% buffer and backwards matching approach may be exploited by malicious users to match Short Orders at prices that are not truly reflective of the current market conditions. An attacker can manipulate the oracle price to fall within the 0.5% buffer and execute trades at an advantage.

Recommendation: The 0.5% buffer and backward matching logic to ensure its robustness against potential exploits. Consider adjusting the buffer threshold based on market volatility and historical price movements. Implement additional safeguards and checks to prevent the abuse of this mechanism.

5. Starting Short ID Manipulation:

Description: The "starting short id" plays a crucial role in the orderbook matching process, as it determines the starting point for matching Short Orders when the oracle price changes. If the starting short id is not derived securely or can be influenced by external factors, it may lead to unintended matching behavior.


If the process of determining the starting short id is not secure or can be manipulated by external factors such as oracle price manipulation or frontrunning, an attacker may be able to influence the matching process and gain an unfair advantage.

**Recommendation**: Ensure that the starting short id is derived securely and cannot be influenced by external factors. Implement robust price feed validation and use multiple reliable oracle sources to mitigate the risk of price manipulation. Consider incorporating time-weighted average prices or other mechanisms to determine the starting short id reliably.

Audit Conclusion:
The security the analysis of the DittoETH smart contracts I identified several potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern, particularly in the orderbook matching algorithm and the handling of Short Orders. The most critical issue is the Short Order matching vulnerability, which allows Short Orders to be matched below the oracle price under certain conditions. Additionally, the oracle price caching mechanism, hint system gaming, and the robustness of the 0.5% buffer and backwards matching approach require further investigation and mitigation.

**To address these issues, it is recommended to:**
- Modify the Short Order matching condition to ensure strict adherence to the oracle price.
- Implement a more robust oracle price caching system that takes into account market volatility and potential price manipulation.
- Strengthen the validation and sanity checks on the hints provided by users in the hint system.
- Secure the derivation of the starting short id and prevent its manipulation by external factors.
