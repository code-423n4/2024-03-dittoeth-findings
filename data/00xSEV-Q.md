1. Add a check to [`_setInitialCR`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/OwnerFacet.sol#L238) to ensure it is set to at least 1 ether, preventing the DAO from having excessive rights, such as setting it to 0 and then creating infinite amounts of dUSD.
2. On other networks, the heartbeat for ETH/USD Chainlink can be set to more than 2 hours, up to 24 hours, which could lead to a fallback to TWAP => possible sandwich attack on Oracle update: using TWAP transaction (which can be too low/high) -> oracle update transaction -> new price transaction.
3. The usage of different feeds: USDC/ETH Uni vs. USD/ETH in Chainlink. In case USDC depegs and Chainlink starts to provide [`invalidFetchData`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/libraries/LibOracle.sol#L76-L77), there will be a jump to a different price. An attacker could mint a lot of dUSD, and when Chainlink's oracle returns to normal, they could sell them for more ETH.
4. It's impossible to shut down a market without debt. It will giv division by 0 error.
   uint256 cRatio = Asset.dethCollateral.div(oraclePrice.mul(Asset.ercDebt));
