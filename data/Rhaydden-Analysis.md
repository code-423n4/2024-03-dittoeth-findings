## 1. Conceptual Overview

DittoETH is a decentralized pegged asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum, inspired by Bitshares' original implementation of polymorphic digital assets (PMDA). It aims to offer censorship resistance, neutrality, custody-less and permissionless trades, and collateral management. DittoETH supports pegged assets for fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies (both long and short positions), and commodities. To issue pegged assets, users must lock a high collateralization of staked ETH in the contract to ensure protocol solvency and price stability. The protocol's neutrality ensures open and full-access trading for any user.

Users can mint DittoAssets by providing collateral in the form of staked ETH, which allows them to gain price exposure to the pegged asset while enjoying the benefits of decentralized cryptocurrencies. The protocol uses an orderbook for matching shorters with long traders, where shorters mint pegged assets by matching with long traders, earning staking rewards and additional collateral. DittoAssets are backed by staked ETH, used as collateral when shorters match with long positions on the orderbook.

DittoAssets track the price of the underlying asset, enabling exposure to various asset classes. They are backed by a 170% collateralization ratio, facilitating DittoAsset minting and managing debt. Shorters must burn DittoAssets to exit, paying off debt and maintaining market stability. The protocol includes unique shorting rules, such as limit orders, to ensure standby liquidity and healthy short positions.

To maintain the peg of dUSD to USD, DittoETH employs mechanisms like redemptions, dynamic tithe adjustments, and forced bids. Liquidation parameters allow for liquidating under-collateralized short positions below 150% and 140% CR. The Treasury Asset Protection Pool (TAPP) supports stability by covering underpayments from under-collateralized short positions.

DittoETH maintains an orderbook for every market, with an automated matching engine for buying and selling pegged assets. It provides interest to collateralized shorts in the form of dETH, with yield distributions periodically updated. The value of DittoAssets is determined by on-chain Chainlink oracle price feeds.


## 2. Approach taken in evaluating the code base

**DittoETH Overview from Code4rena:**
I began by exploring the Code4rena audit overview for DittoETH ([link]( https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-03-dittoeth#toc-1-overview)). This provided a high-level understanding of the project's goals and key components. 

**Blog Documentation:**
Next, I examined the documentation on [DittoETHâ€™s blog]( https://dittoeth.com/blog) to get more insights about the protocol.

**4naly3er Report Analysis:**
The [4naly3er report]( https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md) provided a useful external perspective. The report provides critical technical insights, particularly highlighting areas for gas optimization and security enhancements. Key issues include how `a = a + b` is more gas effective than `a += b` for state variables (excluding arrays and mappings) (GAS-1), Using assembly to check for `address(0)` (GAS-2),  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for function arguments that do not get mutated (GAS-5), etc. Additionally, the report underscores the importance of why `require()` should be used instead of `assert()` (NC-3), why `constants` should be defined rather than using magic numbers (NC-4), etc. These findings are pivotal for refining the DittoETH codebase, focusing on optimizing contract efficiency while maintaining robust security protocols.

**In-Depth Codebase Review:**
Armed with comprehensive project knowledge, I delved into the codebase, file by file and I ran several tests on the contracts.
I first explored the scope of audit. I discovered that the project can be categorized into two(2) main groups: ``Facets and Libraries``. This categorization is based on the typical structure of smart contracts in Ethereum, where Facets are used to implement the logic of the protocol, and Libraries are reusable pieces of code that can be called by Facets to perform common tasks.



### Facets

Facets are contracts that contain the business logic of the protocol. They are designed to be modular, allowing for the addition or modification of functionality without affecting the rest of the system. Here's a brief overview of each of DittoETH's Facets:

- `BidOrdersFacet.sol`: This Facet is responsible for creating and matching bids. It includes functions for placing bids, matching bids with orders, and executing trades based on the bids.

- `ShortOrdersFacet.sol`: This Facet handles the creation and matching of short orders. Short orders are typically used in options trading to sell assets that the trader does not currently own, with the expectation that the price will decrease.

- `PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol`: This Facet is focused on liquidation. 

- `BridgeRouterFacet.sol`: This Facet manages depositing and withdrawing LSTs .

- `ExitShortFacet.sol`: This Facet allows short sellers to exit their positions.

- `RedemptionFacet.sol`: This Facet provides the ability to swap dUSD for ETH, similar to the mechanism provided by Liquidity. 


### Libraries

Libraries are reusable pieces of code that can be called by Facets to perform common tasks. They help in reducing code duplication and improving code maintainability. Here's a brief overview of each Library:

- `LibBridgeRouter.sol`: A helper library used in the BridgeRouterFacet. 

- `LibBytes.sol`: A library used in the RedemptionFacet to save proposals in SSTORE2. 

- `LibOracle.sol`: This library is used to get price information, possibly leveraging Chainlink oracles for price feeds and providing backup mechanisms.

- `LibOrders.sol`: A library used by Order Facets to perform matching. 

- `LibSRUtil.sol`: A library of miscellaneous functions, including recovery functions, minimum short ERC requirements, and transfer functions. 

- `UniswapOracleLibrary.sol`: A library used to get Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) from Uniswap.

  <summary>Details of each contract and details of each function</summary> 


## BidOrdersFacet.sol
The `BidOrdersFacet.sol` contract is specifically designed for managing bid orders in a marketplace. It is designed to work with the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is structured to handle the creation, matching, and settlement of bid orders, which are crucial for trading activities in the platform. It leverages several libraries and interfaces to ensure functionality and security.

##### Language:
Solidity

##### Roles and Access Mechanisms:
`Modifiers:` The contract uses modifiers like `isNotFrozen`, `onlyValidAsset`, and `nonReentrant` to control access and ensure certain conditions are met before executing functions. These modifiers help in preventing reentrancy attacks, ensuring that the contract is not frozen, and that the asset being interacted with is valid.

##### Access Control:
Functions like `createBid` and `createForcedBid` have specific access controls. For example, `createBid` can only be called by addresses that are not frozen and have a valid asset. `createForcedBid` is restricted to contracts that implement the `IDiamond` interface, ensuring that only authorized contracts can create bids on behalf of users.

##### Functions Overview:
- `createBid:` Allows users to create a bid order in the market. It checks for minimum bid size, updates the oracle price, and matches the bid with existing sell orders if possible.
- `createForcedBid:` Similar to `createBid` but is intended for exiting a short position. It is restricted to contracts that implement the `IDiamond` interface.
- `_createBid:` A private function that handles the core logic of creating a bid, including calculating the total ETH required, checking for sufficient ETH escrowed, and adding the bid to the market if no match is found.
- `bidMatchAlgo:` The matching algorithm for bids, which iterates through sell orders to find matches for the incoming bid. It handles partial fills and updates the state accordingly.
- `matchlowestSell:` Settles the lowest sell order and updates the incoming bid based on the match. It handles both short and ask orders, updating the state and balances accordingly.
- `matchIncomingBid:` Finalizes the settlement of the incoming bid, updating the state and balances based on the match. It also handles the removal of dust orders and updates the oracle price if necessary.
- `_getLowestSell:` A private function that retrieves the lowest sell order (either a short or an ask) based on the current state of the market.
- `_shortDirectionHandler:` A private function that determines the direction of short order matching based on the current state and the incoming bid.

## ShortOrdersFacet.sol
The `ShortOrdersFacet.sol` contract is designed for managing short orders. It is designed to be used within a larger contract system, as indicated by the use of modifiers and the import of various libraries and contracts. The contract is structured to handle the creation of limit short orders, which are a type of financial derivative that allows traders to profit from a decrease in the price of an asset.

##### Language:
 Solidity

##### Roles and Access Mechanisms:
`Modifiers:` The contract uses modifiers to enforce certain conditions before executing functions. For example, `isNotFrozen(asset)` ensures that the asset is not frozen before proceeding with the function, `onlyValidAsset(asset)` checks if the asset is valid, and `nonReentrant` prevents re-entrancy attacks.

##### Access Control:
The contract does not explicitly define roles or access control. However, the use of modifiers suggests that access control is implemented at a higher level, possibly in the contract that inherits from Modifiers or in the contract that uses ShortOrdersFacet.

##### Functions:
- `createLimitShort:` This function is the core of the contract. It allows users to create a limit short order. It takes several parameters, including the asset to be shorted, the price at which the short order is placed, the amount of the asset to be shorted, and arrays for order and short hint IDs. It performs several checks and calculations to ensure the order is valid and then adds the order to the system.

##### Constants:
- `C:` A constant contract that likely holds various configuration values, such as minimum collateral ratios (CRATIO_MAX_INITIAL) and other constants used in the contract.

##### Variables:

## PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol
The `PrimaryLiquidationFacet` contract is designed to handle the liquidation of short positions. The contract is structured to facilitate the liquidation of short positions by forcing the shorters to place bids on the market. This process is crucial in maintaining the stability of the platform by ensuring that short positions do not become unsustainable.

##### Language:
 Solidity

##### Roles and Access Mechanisms:
- `Shorter:` The entity that holds a short position. Shorters are the ones being liquidated.
- `Liquidator:` The entity that initiates the liquidation process. In this contract, the liquidator is implicitly the caller of the liquidate function.
- `TAPP:` A special entity within the system that acts as a buffer for liquidations. It is responsible for absorbing the leftover collateral from partially liquidated shorts.

##### Access Control:
The contract uses modifiers like `isNotFrozen`, `nonReentrant`, and `onlyValidShortRecord` to control access to its functions. These modifiers ensure that the contract's functions can only be called under specific conditions, such as when the contract is not frozen, when the caller is not the shorters themselves, and when the short record is valid.


##### Functions:

The contract uses a modular approach, importing various libraries and utilities to perform its operations. It also interacts with other contracts and libraries to manage assets, orders, and user data.

##### Language:
Solidity

##### Roles and Access Mechanisms:
- `Modifiers:` The contract uses modifiers like `isNotFrozen` and `nonReentrant` to control access and prevent reentrancy attacks. These modifiers are applied to functions to ensure that they can only be called under specific conditions, such as when the contract is not frozen and when the function is not being re-entered.
- `Access Control:` The contract uses a combination of internal and external functions to control access. Internal functions can only be called from within the contract or contracts that inherit from it, while external functions can be called from other contracts or externally by users.

##### Functions:

## LibBridgeRouter.sol
The `LibBridgeRouter` is designed to facilitate operations related to bridging specifically within a vault system. It involves bridging assets between different blockchains or within the same blockchain but across different vaults. 

##### Language:
 Solidity

##### Roles and Access Mechanisms:

- `Access Control:` The library does not explicitly implement access control mechanisms like Ownable or AccessControl. Instead, it relies on the context in which it is used to determine access. For example, the `addDeth` function modifies the state of the contract based on the `msg.sender`, which is the address of the caller. This implies that the contract using this library must have its own access control mechanisms in place to ensure that only authorized users can call these functions.

##### Functions:
- `addDeth:` This function is used to credit a user's account with dETH and bridge credit if applicable. It updates the user's bridge credit and the total dETH in the vault.
- `assessDeth:` Determines how much dETH is not covered by bridge credits during withdrawal. It calculates the amount of dETH that needs to be withdrawn from the vault, considering the user's bridge credits.
- `withdrawalFeePct:` Calculates the withdrawal fee percentage based on the premium/discount differential between `rETH` and `stETH` markets. This function is only applicable to `VAULT.ONE`, which has mixed LST.
- `transferBridgeCredit:` Transfers bridge credit from one user to another when an NFT SR is transferred. This function is used to deter workarounds to the bridge credit system.
- `removeDeth:` Updates the user's account upon dETH withdrawal, reducing the amount of dETH escrowed and the total dETH in the vault.

##### Constants:
- `VAULT:` Constants representing different vaults within the system.
- `C.ROUNDING_ZERO:` A constant used for rounding purposes, likely to avoid floating-point issues.

##### Variables:
- `AppStorage:` A struct that holds the global state of the application, including vaults and user data.
- `STypes.VaultUser:` A struct that represents a user within a vault, including their bridge credits and escrowed ETH.

##### Libraries Used:
- `U256 and U88:` Libraries for handling fixed-point arithmetic with 256-bit and 88-bit precision, respectively.
- `OracleLibrary:` A library for fetching and calculating time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) for assets.

##### Interfaces:
- `IBridge:` An interface for interacting with bridge contracts used to fetch the current dETH value for bridging assets.


## LibBytes.sol
`LibBytes.sol` is designed to facilitate operations related to byte manipulation, specifically tailored for the context of reading proposal data from a storage system. It's designed to work with a specific data structure, MTypes.ProposalData, which is not defined within this library but is imported from another contract, DataTypes.sol.

##### Language:
 Solidity

##### Library:
The contract is a library, which means it's a collection of functions that can be used by other contracts but cannot be deployed as a standalone contract. Libraries are often used to encapsulate reusable code.

##### Functions:
- `readProposalData:` This function reads proposal data from a storage system. It takes two parameters: an address `SSTORE2Pointer` which points to the location of the data in storage, and a uint8 `slateLength` which specifies the number of proposal data entries to read.

## 5. Software Engineering Considerations

### Modularity and Reusability:
The contracts in DittoETH exhibit modularity by inheriting from several interfaces and contracts, suggesting components are designed for reuse and extension. This approach aligns with solid software engineering principles, promoting maintainability and scalability.

### Design Patterns and Best Practices:
Utilization of established design patterns, such as interface-based programming and reentrancy guards, indicates adherence to industry best practices. These patterns enhance the contractâ€™s robustness and security.

### Code Readability and Maintainability:
The protocol's structure, naming conventions, and comments suggest an emphasis on readability and maintainability, crucial for long-term management and updates.

### Security:
Security is a critical aspect, especially given the DeFi context. The contract shows awareness of common vulnerabilities (like reentrancy attacks) and includes mechanisms to mitigate them. Continuous security audits and reviews are essential due to the evolving nature of smart contract exploits.

### Efficiency and Optimization:
Given the contract's complexity, there's a need for thorough analysis and testing to ensure efficiency, especially in gas usage.

### Error Handling and Input Validation:
The use of custom error messages and checks indicates a proactive approach to error handling and input validation, critical for robustness and user trust.

### Inter-operability and Standards Compliance:
Compliance with ERC standards and the ability to interact with multiple token types demonstrate a high level of interoperability, a significant factor in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Testing and Documentation:
Given the complexity, comprehensive testing (unit tests, integration tests) and detailed documentation are vital for ensuring the contract works as intended and to facilitate future development.

### Upgradeability:
The potential for future upgrades and modifications should be considered, especially in a rapidly evolving domain like DeFi. However, the contracts doesnâ€™t explicitly mention upgrade mechanisms.

### Dependency Management:
Reliance on external libraries like `OpenZeppelin` means the contract's security and functionality are partly dependent on these external components. Keeping these dependencies updated and secure is crucial.


## 6. Quality of Codebase
In general, the quality of DittoETHâ€™s code base is quite high and easy to understand. The huge number of comments makes it very easy to determine what a particular function is intended for. After an in-depth analysis of the DittoETH codebase, it's clear that the quality is Excellent, showcasing thoughtful architecture and intricate inter-function logic. The codebase demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of blockchain mechanics.



## 7. Risks related to the project
Evaluating the DittoETH project's risk model involves a thorough analysis of various aspects, including administrative, systemic, technical, and integration risks. These risks must be carefully considered to understand their impact on the project's security, functionality, and reliability.


### Administrative risk

The presence of modifiers in `BidOrdersFacet.sol` like `isNotFrozen`, `onlyValidAsset`, `nonReentrant`, and `onlyDiamond` are used to restrict access to certain functions. These are good practices for preventing unauthorized access  and similar administrative functions in other contracts imply a level of centralization.
The `createForcedBid` function in the `BidOrdersFacet.sol` is only callable by contracts that implement the `onlyDiamond` modifier. This function allows for the creation of bid orders for exiting a short, which could be a point of centralization if the decision to exit a short is centralized. However, the mitigation here is that this function is explicitly designed to be callable only by specific contracts, reducing the risk of abuse.

##### Mitigation Strategies:

-	Introduce time-locks for sensitive operations, providing users with a window to react to unfavorable changes.
-	For critical functions that require admin privileges, consider implementing multi-signature wallets to require approval from multiple parties before executing sensitive operations.
-	 Implement a decentralized governance model where proposals to change critical parameters or logic are voted on by token holders.


### Systemic Risks

##### Dependencies on External Protocols: 
The Project imports several libraries and interfaces, such as `U256`, `U88`, `U80` from `PRBMathHelper.sol`, `IDiamond` from `IDiamond.sol`, `PRBMathHelper.sol`, `Errors.sol`, `Events.sol`, `AppStorage.sol`, `DataTypes.sol`, `LibAsset.sol`, `LibShortRecord.sol`, `LibSRUtil.sol`, `LibOracle.sol`, `LibOrders.sol`, `LibBytes.sol`, `Constants.sol`, `SSTORE2.sol`, `console.sol`,etc some of which have been previously audited and are not in scope in this audit. These dependencies proof that the contract relies on external libraries for mathematical operations and for interacting with other contracts or protocols. If any of these libraries or the protocols they interact with are compromised, it could introduce systemic risks.


##### Inter-Contract Dependencies:
The functionality of the system heavily relies on the seamless interaction between contracts like `LibOracle.sol`, `LibOrders.sol`, and various libraries


##### Mitigation Strategies:
- Regularly update and audit the list of supported protocols and bridges to ensure their security and reliability.
- Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to manage failures in inter-contract calls.


### Technical Risks:
##### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: 
Common risks like reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow, and unhandled exceptions are pertinent. Although the project demonstrates good security practices, the complexity of functions like `claimRedemption`  and  `exitShort` increases the surface area for potential exploits.

##### Gas Optimization: 
As highlighted in the 4naly3er report, there are several areas where gas optimization can be improved. Inefficient gas usage could make the system economically unviable in the long term, especially during high network congestion.

##### Mitigation Strategies:
- Continuously audit and test the smart contracts, especially after major updates or integration of new features.
- Implement the suggested gas optimizations to ensure economic efficiency.



### Integration Risks
##### Inter-operability with Multiple Chains:
As a cross-chain solution, integration risks include handling different blockchain protocols, transaction finality times, and consensus mechanisms.

##### External Dependency: 
The project's reliance on prices from the Oracle, OpenZeppelin and other protocols for cross-chain functionality introduces risks associated with these external systems.


##### Mitigation Strategies:
- Conduct thorough testing for each blockchain integration, considering their unique characteristics and potential edge cases.
- Monitor the external protocols and adapt to changes or updates in their systems.




## 8. Recommendations:

1. Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library to prevent unexpected overflows when casting from various type int/uint values

File: contracts/libraries/LibOracle.sol

//@audit `price` is getting converted from `int256` to `uint256`
```solidity
43:             uint256 priceInEth = uint256(price).div(uint256(basePrice));
```

//@audit `basePrice` is getting converted from `int256` to `uint256`
```solidity
43:             uint256 priceInEth = uint256(price).div(uint256(basePrice));
```

//@audit `oraclePrice` is getting converted from `uint256` to `uint80`
```solidity
151:         s.bids[asset][C.HEAD].ercAmount = uint80(oraclePrice);
```


2.  File: contracts/facets/RedemptionFacet.sol
The `claimRemainingCollateral` function needs a little tweak in the way the function reads the `decodedProposalData` array.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```solidity
MTypes.ProposalData[] memory decodedProposalData =
    LibBytes.readProposalData(redeemerAssetUser.SSTORE2Pointer, claimIndex + 1);
MTypes.ProposalData memory claimProposal = decodedProposalData[claimIndex];
```

The function reads the `decodedProposalData` array up to `claimIndex + 1`, but then it accesses the element at `claimIndex`. This means that if `claimIndex` is equal to the length of the array, it will result in an out-of-bounds access, causing the contract to revert with an error.

This can affect the contract's logic in the following way:

1. If a shorter tries to call `claimRemainingCollateral` with a `claimIndex` that is equal to the length of the `decodedProposalData` array, the contract will revert, and the shorter will not be able to claim their remaining collateral.

2. This could potentially lead to situations where collateral is locked in the contract, unable to be claimed by the rightful owner (the shorter).

The code should be modified to read the `decodedProposalData` array up to the correct length, or it should include a check to ensure that `claimIndex` is always within the bounds of the array. This will prevent out-of-bounds accesses and ensure that the `claimRemainingCollateral` function works as intended.

Overall, while this issue may not completely break the contract's functionality, it can lead to unexpected behavior, potential exploits, and collateral being locked in the contract. It's important to address this issue to ensure the contract's reliability and security.



## 9. Conclusion
In general, The DittoETHâ€™s protocol presents a well-designed architecture. The DittoETH protocol exhibits strengths, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation, we believe the team has done a good job regarding the code. However, there is room for improvement, including governance features, optimization, and code documentation. Systemic risks include dependencies on external protocols and inter-contract dependencies, while technical risks involve certain contracts and functions and gas optimization. It is also highly recommended that the team continues to invest in security measures such as mitigation reviews, audits, and bug bounty programs to maintain the security and reliability of the project.
